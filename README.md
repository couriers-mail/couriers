## Development

Couriers is a project fully written in Rust from CLI, SMTP/REST Server to Client
and Web UI Logic.

### Workspace

The software stack is the following:

- `cli`: Uses Clap as CLI Framework
- `client`: Uses Reqwest as WASM and Native HTTP Client
- `server`: Uses Axum as HTTP Server
- `web`: Uses Leptos as Web UI Framework

### Use of the Rust `Nightly` Channel

This project uses Rust's Nightly Channel as de-facto Rust Toolchain, this is
because [Leptos takes advantage of the nightly channel][1] to provide a better
development experience.
